# VRC Avatar/World Support Tools

I had created a series of unity script tools to aid in figuring out what might be going wrong with a live avatar or world back before Udon was released for worlds. While the basic functionality still works to this day, with some caveats, live testing doesn't work due to the issues with just getting a direct link to avatars/worlds along with the API changes that block the ability to do so. I've seen as VRChat has impemented security measures more and more, and all of them have been thwarted relatively quickly and some being entirely ineffective. Some ripping tools performed some similar functions, but were not as fleshed out at the time and for some time after. It had support, all at once and any amount if you wanted to, for loading from file, cache (UI unfinished), and online (direct url). Along with a number of optional settings, to which the specifics elude me as so much time has passed. As with any tool like this it could have also easily been used for ripping, hence why it has never seen the light of day. It has served me well in the past for assisting many others with their Unity troubles.
