# Warframe's <a href="https://completelyunbelievable.github.io/Experiments/wf/sentientShip.html">sentientShip</a> and <a href="https://completelyunbelievable.github.io/Experiments/wf/worldState.html">worldState</a> [Deprecated]

World State would make all worldstate information visible and parsable, while Sentient Ship would do the same thing except it would display the sentient ship's location in a easily readable way. Fully deprecated due to changes to CORSAnywhere, was always intended as a quick and dirty stopgap until the fanmade website caught up to the changes.
