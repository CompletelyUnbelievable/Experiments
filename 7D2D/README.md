7d2d mod files. How to install them: https://7daystodiemods.com/how-to-install-7-days-to-die-mods/

Check the mod's ModInfo or Mod files for a description of what it does and what version of 7d2d it is known to work with.
I do not use the 7d2d mod launcher, but I included Mod.xml for convinence even when I have no idea if it'll work.
