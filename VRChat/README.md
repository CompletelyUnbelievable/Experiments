A while back VRChat changed the way that avatars and worlds were cached to try an obfuscate which cache files were which. This was meant as a little utility for converting the id to the cache folder name. Somewhat soon after VRChat changed the cache system yet again, so it does not work anymore. I never ended up posting it here since I was working on some related unity tools at the time.
