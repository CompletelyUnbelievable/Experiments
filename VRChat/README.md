A while back VRChat changed the way that avatars and worlds were cached to try an obfuscate which cache files were which. This was meant as a little utility for converting the id to the cache folder name similar to what is seen <a href="https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/blob/aec7d9356d6d00cd8cf1e5ebb2e46550cc6e4d98/AssetBundleCacher.cs#L37">here</a>. Somewhat soon after VRChat changed the cache system yet again, so it does not work anymore. I never ended up posting it here since I was working on some related unity tools at the time.
